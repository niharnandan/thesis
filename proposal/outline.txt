1) motivation
    * introduce the fact that sea-level modeling is important
      --> get some figures/projections from IPCC AR5 report
      --> motivate fact that we care about sea levels
      --> temperature and CO2 forcing affect projections for sea levels
    * DOECLIM:  radiative forcing --> temperatures (and ocean heat uptake)
      --> could have a figure from Kriegler thesis if a good depiction
    * GMSL:     temperatures --> sea level changes (Rahmstorf 2007 is the reference)
      --> the two of these combined gives a simplified model for how radiative forcing (CO2 emissions) affect temperatures and sea level projections
      --> show some of the main equations for each (include some figure)

2) we want good accurate projections, but want to account for uncertainties
    * motivate the need for model calibration
      --> Figure: uncalibrated simulation from GMSL model vs obs
    * talk about MCMC (main equations, what is the model, what is the data, likelihood functions, etc...)
      --> Figure: uncalibrated simulation from GMSL model vs obs
                  + calibrated simulations (the entire MCMC ensemble, shaded region for 5-95% credible interval)
    * show history plots, gelman and rubin diagnostics, ACF
    * want to be clear that we're only doing GMSL here with a historical temperature data forcing the model

    ** talk about how we've already done this, and what we intend to do **
    --> want to incorporate temperature uncertainties

3) previous work with DOECLIM+Rahmstorf GMSL model set-up
      --> figure from Tony
          MCMC calibration DOECLIM+GMSL emulator, projections of sea-level rise
    * that work (and all others) assumed the different data sets' errors are independent
      --> the advance we want to make is accounting for these dependencies, because we know the uncertainties in temp/sea level/ocean heat uptake are correlated
    * we want to examine how projections in sea level are affected by accounting for/neglecting this uncertainty structure

4) show the likelihood function and the error covariance matrices
    * we are already using AR1, can show that matrix
    * what we are using (just one block of AR1 for sea level),
        and what we want to use to account for temps ocean heat (three blocks of AR1)
        and what we want to account for the correlated residuals (three blocks, plus off-diagonal components)

5) offer a schedule of when you are going to tick off various waypoints.
    * timeline, into the spring
