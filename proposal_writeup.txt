What we've done so far -
1. Simple MCMC chain to estimate parameters for any arbitrary dataset.
2. Built the AR1 matrix . Our chain now has 5 parameters. 
3. Build the DOECLIM (Diffusion Ocean Energy Climate Model) - converted code from R,Fortran to Python

What we're going to do - 
1. Change the MCMC model to take in temperatures and output sealevel.
2. Build a larger AR1 matrix to account for the relation between Sealevel, Ocean heat and Temperature.
3. We will consider doing AR2 (extra parameter to add to the MCMC chain). Did AR1 because it's the simpler first step.
